# VuePractice repository

Repository collection of projects I'm coding in Vue for practice to learn the framework

Some practices studied in this repository is the use of Vue, VueX, State Management, Global Functions, Optional / Composition Api

Each folder will have an additional ReadMe detailing information about the project

A lot of the projects will have comments documenting my progression
