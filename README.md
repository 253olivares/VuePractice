# VUE Journey Repository

This is my main Vue repository where I plan to update and post modules of me learning Vue JS.

I began my JS framework journey at the beginning of 2024 

I left my previous job position and returned to my field of study. To do this I had to study new up to date coding frameworks. After graduating college in 2022 I felt like my web development knowledge was lacking leading me to leave the area of study for a while. 

Now back I have begun studying Vue js and React js. This repository will be dedicated to documenting any VUE JS progression. Currently at the time I am focused on React so I will only periodically update this repository. 

### Coding Sources

The primary sources I utilize to learn Vue are Vue documentation on the official page and several Vue YouTube videos. Some of which I will provide below. Document by document I will record my sources for each module when I can. 

[STATE & STORE | VueJS & Vuex | Learning the Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CSr2vBApSI&t=2s "STATE & STORE | VueJS & Vuex | Learning the Basics")

[Learn Vue.js - Full Course for Beginners - 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4deVCNJq3qc&t=6289s "Learn Vue.js - Full Course for Beginners - 2019")

[The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_xLMmNeLDY&t=16485s "The Ultimate Vue 3 Tutorial (100% Composition API)")

[Vue.js Tutorial: Beginner to Front-End Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GNsWa_EZdw&t=10157s "Vue.js Tutorial: Beginner to Front-End Developer")

By far the best method I have found to learn any coding languages to by utilizing online resources and following allong tutorials. Seeing the coding transform and your code and change it does wonders for learning. 

## File Structure

Each folder is annotated with either practice or project to identify their scope
Practices will usually be smaller coding practices that I use/create to understand react concepts.

Projects: Larger projects that combine a lot of the practices I have learned

Each folder may have its readme and comments in the code documenting my programming progression.

Thank you so much for your time for reading!
