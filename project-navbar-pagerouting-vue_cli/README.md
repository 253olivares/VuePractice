# VuePractice Page Routing

This is a vue practice to help get adjusting to using vue routes.

In this practice we I use composite API and Options to create a crud application. Most bugs have been ironed out.

The application itself requires the use of localstorage db on users browser to allow the page to save changes.

If pages exists in local storage then we load data from our own page.json and then continue to keep and updates changes based on user local storage.

To run this project download project root folder and run
