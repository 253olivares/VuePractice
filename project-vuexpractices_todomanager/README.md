# Vuex Todo Manager

This is a todo manager created.

Fundamentals: Global State Manager, AXIOS, Using A API

This project is fairly short and currently has a bug where new todos can not be changed or updated due to the api no allowing new read and writes. We are using json api placeholder api to create our todo list. When ever we create a new todo we append to the beginning of the array but dont push it to the api since it doesnt alow write.

Fundamentals : Api integration using axios with vue, Global State manager
